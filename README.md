# CICADA — Agency Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for the **CICADA** agency portfolio website.  
The site is designed to showcase our approach to modern web design and engineering — focused on clarity, performance, and system-level thinking.

## About CICADA

**CICADA** is a web design and development agency specializing in building high-performance digital systems.  
We treat design and engineering as a single, integrated process to create websites that are scalable, efficient, and intentional.

This portfolio reflects those principles through its structure, animations, and technical decisions.

## Tech Stack

The website is built using a lightweight, performance-first stack:

- **HTML5** — semantic structure  
- **CSS3** — custom styling and animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — interactivity and logic  
- **GSAP** — motion and transition animations  
- **TypeScript** — scalable client-side logic  
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling where applicable  

No heavy frameworks are used to keep the site fast, maintainable, and transparent.

## Features

- Minimal, system-oriented design  
- Performance-conscious animations  
- Modular and scalable code structure  
- Responsive across devices  
- Custom loading and transition effects
